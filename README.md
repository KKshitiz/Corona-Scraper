## How the project idea evolved:
_During the lockdown period, I was looking for some python projects, specifically in the web scraping domain. All the projects that I came through on the web were mostly related to scraping tweets from twitter or some random html from dummy websites or stuff more or less similar to the formers. Then the idea of scraping websites for data of COVID-19 effected countries crossed my mind. Although websites did great at serving the information to people on the web, a desktop application would go a step further by providing information at your desktop. Moreover, it would be helpful if it could work offline._

## Technologies used:
  - python3
  - beautifulsoup4
  - tkinter library
  - requests library

## How to install requirements:
  - pip install tkinter
  - pip install beautifulsoup4
  - pip install requests
    
## Create your own executable
    '''
    pip install pyinstaller
    cd script_folder
    pyinstaller script.py                       //for executable with dependencies
    pyinstaller --onefile script.py             //standalone executable file with terminal
    pyinstaller --onefile -w script.py          //standalone executable without terminal
    '''
    
**The executable will be located in the script_folder/dist directory**
<br>
_To create a setup use NSIS open source software_
<br>
_To compress the exe significantly use strip.exe then UPX_

- Websites constantly change. Once the siteâ€™s structure has changed, the scraper might not be able to navigate the sitemap correctly or find the relevant information.
