## Disclaimer
- All the data are fetched from third-party websites and I am in no way responsible for the correctness of it
- Websites constantly change. Once the siteâ€™s structure has changed, the scraper might not be able to navigate the sitemap correctly or find the relevant information.
- In such a scenario, please either contact me [skilite007@gmail.com] or submit a pull request suggesting the required changes
